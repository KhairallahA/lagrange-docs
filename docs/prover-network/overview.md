description: Introduction to Lagrange Prover Network
---

Lagrange’s ZK Prover Network is the foundational layer that offers universal proof generation for a variety of use cases, such as rollups, ZK coprocessing and cross-chain messaging. It is [deployed on EigenLayer](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/0x22cac0e6a1465f043428e8aef737b3cb09d0eeda) and supported by over 85 of the top institution-grade operators who each run several provers to deliver ZK proofs that are requested by users. Due to the specific architecture of Lagrange’s ZK Prover Network, it is able to support high volumes of proof requests without bottlenecks, and offers high liveness guarantees and a simple interface to engage with.
