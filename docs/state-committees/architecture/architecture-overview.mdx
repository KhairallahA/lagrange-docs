The Lagrange State Committee (LSC) network are conceptually similar to Ethereum's Sync Committee and will serve as a foundation for crypto-economic secure and trustless light client-based cross-chain bridging and messaging.

## Ethereum Light Client vs Lagrange State Committee Light Client

The Ethereum Light Client utilizes a sync committee of 512 randomly chosen validators that sign new block headers every 27 hours. This system enables light clients to verify chain state without knowledge of the entire validator set. However, its security is limited by the fixed committee size, with an estimated economic security threshold of about $18 million. This cap on security becomes problematic as the value secured by light client bridges increases, potentially making attacks economically viable when the secured assets exceed the security threshold.

The Lagrange State Committee light client implements a scalable approach to address these limitations. It employs an unbounded set of nodes with leveraged rehypothecated collateral, either restaked with EigenLayer or staked with liquid staking derivatives. This architecture allows for dynamic scaling of security as required, accommodating an expanding set of validators. The Lagrange system features a flexible attestation period and supports state proofs for EVM-based chains beyond Ethereum. By enabling dynamic scaling of collateral behind each attestation, the Lagrange State Committee facilitates generalizable state proofs of arbitrary chains with super-linear security, overcoming the constraints of the fixed-size Ethereum sync committee.

## Technical Note
Our technical approach is inspired by the current implementation of the Ethereum sync committees that is used by Ethereum light clients to verify that an Ethereum block header d’ is valid, assuming a previous block header d is valid (without re-executing all transactions that lead from d to d’). 

In particular, given two Ethereum blocks headers d and d’, and assuming you trust d, an Ethereum light client can verify that block header d’ is valid by verifying an aggregate signature by a certain number of public keys that are contained in either the current committee or the next committee field of d. The individual signatures are computed by Ethereum nodes that actually check the validity of d’ by replaying all transactions.

LSC was designed by combining Lagrange’s ZK Prover Network and EigenLayer restaking. State Committees borrow security from Ethereum by dual staking with both EigenLayer and the rollup’s native token.

## Key Components
The key components of the Lagrange State Committee protocol are the ***sequencer**, **Database**, **gRPC Server**, **Consensus**, and **attestation nodes***.

- The **Sequencer** is responsible for fetching L2 batch data from L1 (Ethereum), and L2 blocks from EVM rollup chains and updating the database. 
- The **Database** stores new finalized batch with aggregate signatures and send non finalized batches to consensus for verification. 
- The **gRPC Server** a physical somponent of the architecture is responsible for communicating with attestation nodes.  
- The **Consensus** is responsible for computing aggregate signature and ensuring 67% of total voting power is used to sign the batch in order to consider it as finalized.
- The **Attestation Nodes** are operators in the LSC protocol that participates in aggregate signature generation.

**State Committee Contracts** - The Lagrange service and Lagrange committee smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. The smart contract manages epoch updates,voting power updates and calculates the Merkle tree. 

The attestation nodes can easily verify the given committee root is correct or not based on on-chain data through the smart contract.

## LSC Node Requirements

Lagrange Nodes are the attesters within the Lagrange State Committees infrastructure that are responsible for signing the state roots of different chains. Lagrange cross-chain State Committees are not designed to replace proofs of consensus but instead are an alternative mechanism for chains whose finality or consensus is not proveable within a zero-knowledge context.

Nodes wishing to join the cross-chain State Committees must restake via EigenLayer. A node must provide at least 10 ETH worth of rehypothecated collateral to join the network and must indicate which chain or roll-up they wish to provide attestations for.

Every node in the network must run a containerized validator or watcher of a relevant chain or roll-up. If If an operator manages multiple restaked Ethereum nodes, they can establish a secure RPC connection to a single instance of the chain’s validator, ideally running locally on their system, for all nodes. Once in the network, the attestation node will sign the batch of rollup blocks using their BLS key (BN254 curve).

## Responsibilities of a Cross-Chain State Attester

Each cross-chain state attester is responsible for executing a signature with its BLS (BN254)key on every finalized batch during the attestation periods that it is active for. Each signature is executed on a tuple containing a block header, a Merkle root of the public keys of the current committee and a Merkle root of the public keys of the next committee.

```
struct block {
    var block_header,
    var current_committee,
    var next_committee,
}
```

The signature executed on the tuple creates slashable conditions for fraud proofs on malicious nodes. Before executing each signature, a cross-chain State Committees node must independently check the state of both Ethereum and the attested chain and perform the three basic checks:

1. The block_header is correct and corresponds to a finalized block of the chain that is being attested to.

2. The current_committee Merkle root was correctly derived from the public keys of the attestation set on Ethereum for a given block of the arbitrary chain.

3. The next_committee Merkle root was correctly derived by altering the current_commitee at the end of the attestation period with any nodes who opted to enter or leave the attestation set.
