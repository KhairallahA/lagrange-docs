description: The steps to register operator to State Committees AVS
---

Assuming you have successfully set up the keystore, you can run the following commands to register your operator to Lagrange State Committees AVS and subscribe to the [rollup chains](/state-committees/operator-guide/supported-chains).

1. Run `register-operator` command.
2. Run `subscribe-chain` command.

After successfully running the above two commands, your operator will be able to participate from the next epoch period in the State Committees and start performing attestations. The next step is to deploy attestation node/s.

Alternatively, the operators can also use [scripts](/state-committees/run-node/scripts) instead of CLI commands to perform the above mentioned steps.
