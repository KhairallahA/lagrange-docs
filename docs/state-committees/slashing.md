If a cross-chain state attestor executes a signature on an incorrect header or State Committeeâ€™s root for a given batch using its BLS key, the attestor must be slashed. An incorrect message could be due to:

- Incorrect `committee_header` data: The attestor signs an incorrect committee root.

- Incorrect `batch_header` data: The attestor signs an incorrect batch of blocks. 

For slashing to occur in a trustless fashion, there must be a deterministic set of conditions under which a signature can be considered incorrect. Verifying the object that a node signed with its BLS key is trivial to do on-chain with a cost of ~110,000 gas.

To prove that a node attested to an incorrect committee root, a proof must show that the root signed by a given node incorrectly includes or excludes a specific public key. As committees are stored in contracts on Ethereum, the required leaf nodes can easily be referenced on-chain as part of proving inclusion or exclusion within a committee root for slashing.

Proving that a signature on a given batch header is invalid requires that a correct batch header can be settled on Ethereum in a trust minimized manner. As settlement on Ethereum is only required in the event of slashing, slow forms can be used without compromising the time required for proof generation.

The following forms of state settlement can be used as a source of truth to trigger trust minimized slashing on Ethereum:

**Arbitrum & Base, Optimism**: A finalized roll-up batch that has cleared the fraud proof window on Ethereum.
